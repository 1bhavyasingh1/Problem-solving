Arithmetic Progression
c-b=d so c=b+d----(1)
b-a=d so a=b-d----(2)
by(1) and (2)
a+c=2b
2b-c = a
2b-a = c
so to find if a can be multiplied to make it an AP we do(2b-c)%a will be equal to 0 if it is possible to make an AP
also using else if() here

IMPORTANT NOTE:
if the size of the new array is 5 and you have not taken it as an input using i=1 loop then by default the indexing is 0 1 2 3 4
SO if you cout<<array[array.size()] a garbage value will gfet printed
-> In this question even if n is 6 we are taking maxi=n-1=5 because our square vector also going to have 0 i.e {0 1 4 9}
ALGORITHM
1)KeepinG the ptr on the last element of the square vector.
2) subtratcting i from the square[ptr] to get the element that will be pushed in the ans vector.
3)If that element exceeds n or that element has alreday being pushed then we decrement the pointer which takes us to the second last element in the square vector
  and now the next element is found by subtracting i from the new square[ptr];
4)We insert element in the ans vector such that the sum of the element and the index in which it is inserted is a perfect square i.e. ans[element]=i; element - 12  12+13=25 which is a perfect square

Changing the return 0 after case 1 to continue otherwise it gave only onw output that is zero

CASE 1:
if number of pairs is even
number of cakes will also be EVEN
so invite everyone
unhappiness value will be zero

CASE 2:
If number of pairs is odd:
Then we will remove 1 person, so even pairs will remain on condition that 1 person that will be removed forms odd number of pairs.
SUBCASE:
But what if every single person forms even pairs only then we will remove a pair such that both members of that pair form even pairs individually

IF you don't specify the size of the vector, you don't get the output
#cout<<setprecision(10)  without this it will give wrong answer.
v[i]+t[i] gives us the total time taken by the person
v[i]-t[i] gives us the position of the house of the person
so we are actually doing [position of the leftmost house(mini) + position of the rightmost house(maxi)]/2
We are assigning the leftmost and rightmost position on the basis of TIME.

We have to make segments such as the sum of the differences of all segments is 0;
So if n is odd its just not possible because there will always be one integer remaining;
In the question it is given that a segment can consist of a single integer also (li<=ri)
so what we do is the numbers whose sum we get as non-zero we put them in one segment like {1,1}{-1,-1} so what will happen is within the segment their difference will be 0 i.e. {1-1}+{-1-(-1)}
and for the numbers whose sum is already 0 we will consider that single integer as one segment i.e. 1,-1 so {1}+{-1} as we can take (li<=ri).

if type is 0:
sum will be sum+=query*n_even
then all even numbers will be turned odd for the next input of >>type>>queries.
if type is 1:
sum will be sum+=query*n_odd
Then all odd numbers will become even for the next input of >>type>>queries.

We append the string s after string s so the our string becomes like "rggryrggry", we do this because after the last 'r' if it does not find any 'g' it starts from 0th index again until it finds a 'g'
now we store the index of all the occurences of green light 'g' in a vector.
We want the green signal 'g' to be in front of our 'r', to make that sure we use j to iterate over the vector to find a 'g' whose index is greater than 'r' we use while(pos_g[j]<i) j++;pos_g[j] gives us the index of the 'g'.
As soon as we find our first 'g' we caculate the distance of that 'g' from 'r' (pos_g[j]-i)
And our objective is to find the maximum distance between 'r' and the first occurence of 'g' on the right of that 'r'.

and the maximum value that a[i+1] can get is b[i+1] therefore
b[i+1] has to be >= b[i]-1
According to the Newton school IIT-KGP youtube guy the questions means that a[i] can be <= a[i]+1 which gave a correct answer BUT
In the question it is given a[i] can be <= a[i+1]

if k is odd then we can make pairs like odd even
                                        odd even
                                        odd even
because we can add our odd k to the odd number and make it even as odd+odd=even

Key Takeaway:
Don't declare the size of the vector in which you are going to push_back
Otherwise output will be all 0's 0 0 0 0
                                 0 0 0

"maxi = max(maxi, (i+1)*(n-1-i))"
This statement means that we are finding the maximum number of attachments of 3 numbers that can be made such that it is neither in ascending order nor in descending order
i.e. a<b>c if a,b,c are the 3 numbers
we are partitioning on the basis of distinct numbers so "111223" we will partition like "111" and "223"
(i + 1) -> number of element till index i
(n-1-i) -> number of element after index i

dividing the matrix into smaller 2x2 matrices:
if there are atleast 2 zeroes, number of 1's is the number of operations
if there is atleast 1 zero, x-1 operations(where x is the number of 1's)
0 zeroes,x-2 operations

sum+=*it;
s.clear();
